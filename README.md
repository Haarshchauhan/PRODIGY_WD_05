Hello everyone!!!

I‚Äôm thrilled to share that I‚Äôve successfully completed my fifth task as a Web Development Intern at Prodigy InfoTech! üöÄ

‚ú® Task Details:
I developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to get the current weather and an 8-hour forecast for any city. The functionalities include:
1Ô∏è‚É£ City Weather Search: Users can enter a city name to get the current weather details and an hourly forecast.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays the temperature, weather description, and wind speed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ 8-Hour Forecast: Provides an 8-hour weather forecast with temperature and weather icons.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling: Alerts users if the city name is invalid or if there is an issue fetching data.

To build this, I implemented functions to handle user input, fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and display the data dynamically on the webpage.
